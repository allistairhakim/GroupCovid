      <h5 class="card-title"><b>There is a high likely hood of another surge of COVID-19. Be mentally and physically prepared for a second lockdown.</b></h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Thermal Scanners cannot detect COVID 19</li>
        <li>Coronaviruses have a spike-like structure on their surface called an S protein. (The spikes create the corona-like, or crown-like, appearance that gives the viruses their name.) The S protein attaches to human cells. From there on, the virus uses DNA and RNA to multiply. A vaccine that targets this protein might prevent it from binding to human cells and stop the virus from taking over the body.  </li>
        <li>If you don't know, there is a new strain of the coronavirus and was originally called 2019-nCoV.</li>
        <li>Keep stimulating human interaction, hence mental health is important in times when our country is bereft of over 2 million people.</li>
        <li>Covid-19 erupted out of nowhere, the best way to solve this problem is staying calm and FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS FROM PRESIDENT AND GOVERNMENT
